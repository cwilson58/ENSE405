## Business Opportunity

Current tools for tracking food consumption focus on hitting your daily targets and disregard how you feel. Analyzing what your habits are at a high level, and finding if there are patterns that can be used to your advantage will lead to a more sustainable diet in terms of your health, and can prevent over consumption and/or purchasing of food leading to excess waste.

## UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
